FRITZL’S FRIENDS</h2>
</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>


<p>On the snow covered stones of the Stephansplatz of Vienna,
Fritzl and Tzandi danced joyously. The boy Fritzl because
it was Christmas Eve. Because also in the rapid motion
his little body forgot how poorly it was clad. While Tzandi,
the terrier of “Schottisch” or Scottish ancestry, danced because
anything his small master did was pleasing in his sight, and
to be copied, if possible. Under Fritzl’s chin was tucked a
violin; and as the boy danced he played snatches of melody:
bits of Hungarian folk songs, and bars of the waltzes the
Viennese love, which set the feet of the passers-by moving
more swiftly. But not one kreutzer had been slipped into the
boy’s hand, although it was Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Now Fritzl and Tzandi had no home. For only that Christmas
Eve, the cross old woman, of whose cellar they had made a
pitiful refuge, had warned them of what they might expect,
if they came within her house again. Indeed, neither Fritzl
nor Tzandi could remember any home save the cellar, and
before that, the attic where they had lived with the blind musician,
who, dying, had left his cherished violin to the little boy,
whose heart and fingers were overflowing with music. “I
tell you what, Tzandi,” cried Fritzl, as toward midnight boy
and dog sought shelter in one doorway after another of the
Stephansplatz, only to be driven forth: “There’s a lovely
corner by the Riesenthor! I forgot all about it till now. Let’s
go there, it’s the very place! ’Course Santa Claus will go through
that very door into the cathedral, and can hear us when we
tell him we’re waiting for him. Why, just as easy, Tzandi!”</p>

<p>So they crept into one of the sculptured niches of the “Giant’s
Gate,” where the great wings of the angels announcing the
birth of the Christ Child made an insufficient shelter. Suddenly
the carved portals opened, and one of the sacristans of the
cathedral came forth, and looked about the now almost deserted
square.</p>

<p>Then like two little spirits, Fritzl and Tzandi slipped into
the porch, and from there into the solemn church.</p>

<p>Once Tzandi looked up anxiously into his master’s face, as
if he feared that Santa Claus might not find them there. “Of
course he will,” laughed Fritzl, answering the dog’s silent
question; “Why, I’m surprised you didn’t know he’ll be sure
to come in here to say ‘Merry Christmas’ to the Blessed
Mother, first thing in the morning!”</p>

<p>Tzandi wagged his tail in relief, as if his last fear were quieted.</p>

<p>Like shadows, through the shadows of the vast nave passed
boy and dog, straight to the statue of the Blessed Mother. And
upon the pavement at her feet, safely hidden in the shelter
made by the sculptures of her shrine, they nestled closely against
each other.</p>

<p>“Now isn’t this the very beautifullest place in all the world
to be in Christmas Eve?” asked Fritzl drowsily, dropping his
head upon Tzandi’s shaggy hide.</p>

<p>And Tzandi, already half asleep, wagged his tail blissfully.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p>“Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! It’s time to get
up, little master,” barked Tzandi, as the first pale gleams of
the Christmas sunrise crept through the painted window above
the high altar of St. Stephans.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! So it is,” answered
Fritzl sleepily; “but does your head too feel awful funny,
Tzandi? All light and hot? And your feet all cold and heavy?”
By a languid wag of his tail, Tzandi assured his master that
all was indeed as he had said. “I tell you what it is,” said the
boy; “we’re just hungry. And Santa Claus hasn’t come. I
s’pose there are so many children in Vienna, he couldn’t help
being late getting around to us. Oh, but don’t you wish he’d
come!”</p>

<p>A frantic wagging of Tzandi’s tail, and the thrusting of his
cold nose into his master’s hand, answered as plainly as words
could have done. “Let’s go out to the Stephansplatz,” went
on Fritzl, rising weakly to his feet; “and I’ll play, and you
shall dance, and surely, Christmas morning, someone will give
us some kreutzers. And—and—” The words trailed off
drowsily.</p>

<p>The boy shook himself impatiently. “I never felt so sleepy
as this before,” he thought; “and Christmas too!” Then
after an awkward little “reverence” before the Blessed Mother,
and a “Merry Christmas” whispered softly to her, Fritzl
went down the broad nave to the Riesenthor, pushed open one
of its portals slowly, and with his violin held closely to him,
and followed by Tzandi, went without, and stood, a forlorn
little figure, upon the broad stone step.</p>

<p>The hour for early mass had not yet come, but the Stephansplatz
was already filled with people, singing Christmas carols.
The booths were fringed with evergreen; every window was
a blaze of color; and the people, as they walked or danced along,
waved boughs of hemlock, so that the square looked almost
as if the long vanished pine forests were once more growing in
Old Vienna.</p>

<p>“Now what did I tell you, Tzandi,” Fritzl cried triumphantly,
if somewhat shakily. “Just look at all those boys and girls!
’Course Santa Claus hasn’t forgotten us, but he couldn’t help
being a bit late, Tzandi dear. Any minute now, he may come!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the direction of the Graben, came the sound
of cheering. The crowd opened, like great waves parted by
some mighty wind, and into the Stephansplatz came a closed
carriage drawn by two black horses. Slowly it passed along,
the white-haired man within bowing kindly to right and left,
straight to where Fritzl and Tzandi waited, at the Riesenthor.
At the foot of the steps, the carriage stopped. A groom in
quiet livery opened the door. And wrapped in furs from head
to feet, the white-haired man stepped out. Beneath his bushy
eyebrows, eyes as clear and blue as those of a child looked forth.
And the lips under the heavy white moustache were smiling,
as he mounted the steps.</p>

<p>Fritzl gave a little gasp of pure delight. Deaf to the words
the crowd were crying, of the identity of the white-haired, fur-wrapped
figure, he had no doubt.</p>

<p>It must be Santa Claus.</p>

<p>The relaxed little figure straightened; the thin little hands
were outstretched; and lifting his happy eyes to the friendly
ones looking straight into them, Fritzl cried:</p>

<p>“Tzandi, Tzandi, he’s come!”</p>

<p>And fell, a limp little heap, at the feet of “Unser Franz.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p>Just about the time when Fritzl and Tzandi waked, that
Christmas morning, two little children within the palace at
Schönbrunn were welcoming the Christ Child’s Day.</p>

<p>One, a boy of eleven, known throughout Austria-Hungary as
“the little lame Prince,” was the Archduke Maximilian. The
other, a girl of nine, was the
Archduchess Elizabeth. But
to each other, and the imperial
family at Vienna, they
were known as “Max” and
“Betty.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp62" id="image010" style="max-width: 41.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image010.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Max had been the first to
waken; but for a time he
laid very still, cuddled within
the soft blankets of his bed,
his young heart beating happily,
at the thought of what
the day was to bring to him.
Ever since he was born, the
little Prince had been crippled.
But for nearly two years, the famous surgeon of the
Kinderspitzel of Vienna had been treating him; and this
Christmas Day he was to walk, for the first time in his life.
And all the great empire of Austria-Hungary was waiting for
the test, almost as eagerly as he. For when the good Emperor,
his grandfather, should cease to reign, Max would be “Unser
Kaiser” to millions of people.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, and come in, Betty!” called Max excitedly.</p>

<p>And a small girl, crying as excitedly, “Merry Christmas,
Maxchen, and I knew perfectly well you’d say it first!” pushed
open the door, and running across the room, threw herself
down by Maxchen’s bed, flinging her soft arms around her
brother’s neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty, Betty,” he cried, as he nestled against her, “it
seems almost too good to be true! Only it must come true,
mustn’t it, Christmas Day?”</p>

<p>“’Course it must,” agreed Betty stoutly; “why, didn’t the
Herr Doctor tell you it would come true, this very day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” breathed Max softly.</p>

<p>“And there’s nothing in the world, the Herr Doctor doesn’t
know,” declared Betty; “and I love him.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” cried Max; “almost as much as Grandpapa
Franzchen!” For by that name, born of affection, was the
august Emperor of Austria-Hungary known to his grandchildren.</p>

<p>“Betty,” the boy cried abruptly, “the very first race we’ll
run will be from there,” pointing to the “Gloriette,” shining
like a jewel in the sunrise light,—“straight to the edge of the
lily pond. And—and—I’ll beat you, you little girl!”</p>

<p>“Can’t!” answered Betty, stretching out her slim straight
legs, and looking at them with confidence.</p>

<p>“Can!” Max cried delightedly. And then they both laughed,
and cuddled together more closely.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” Max went on, “that boy we watched,
in the rose garden, running races with his dog, one day last
summer? The boy with a violin under his arm?”</p>

<p>Yes, Betty remembered.</p>

<p>“My, how he ran!” sighed Max, “and we called and called
to him, and finally made ‘Goggles’” (this the most dignified
of the tutors of the Prince) “go after him. But of course he
couldn’t run fast enough, and the boy got quite away. I wish
I could find that boy. Betty,” rising on one elbow, “when I
walk, I will! I do so want that boy and that dog!”</p>

<p>“Why,” laughed matter-of-fact Betty, “you’ve heaps of
boys to play with, and heaps of dogs!”</p>

<p>“But not one boy who can play the violin. And not one dog
that can dance.”</p>

<p>“Well, that dog was a dear,” Betty agreed cordially; “and—why,
Maxchen,” she went on, “we’ll ask Grandpapa Franzchen
to get the boy and the dog for us, this very Christmas
Day. We’ll—” But the little maid’s blithe voice was interrupted
by the sound of footsteps in the corridor. The door
opened softly, “His Majesty the Emperor and the Herr Doctor,”
was solemnly announced. And into the sunlit room, two
stately men came.</p>

<p>We know quite well how “Unser Franz” looked. We saw
him, that very morning, speaking kindly to Fritzl and Tzandi,
at the Riesenthor.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas—Merry Christmas, dear Grandpapa
Franzchen and dear Herr Doctor!” cried the children. And
Betty slipped quickly to the floor, and curtsied demurely
<a id="to"></a>to the Emperor.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!” returned the Emperor
and Doctor gaily, who had wisely given the children the
longed-for chance to say it first.</p>

<p>Then the old Kaiser caught Betty up in his arms, and kissed
her forehead. “Now God bless thee, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><a id="Liebchen"></a>Liebchen</span><a id="pg11"></a>,” he said, seating
himself in the great chair beside the bed, and bending over and
kissing Max on both his cheeks. Then, with an arm around
each grandchild, he looked up at the Herr Doctor, standing
straight and tall beside him.</p>

<p>A very king of men was the Herr Doctor, with stalwart
shoulders, and kindly grave eyes, the color of the sea, when the
sky is clouded.</p>

<p>“Well, your Highness,” he said, in a voice as tender as his
eyes, “all ready to walk to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Max bravely, but nestling closer against
his grandfather.</p>

<p>Then the Herr Doctor looked down into the anxious face of
the old Emperor.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty need have no fear of the result of to-night’s
test,” he said softly, “the little lad will walk.”</p>

<p>“And Grandpapachen,” cried Betty, breaking into the
solemn pause which followed, “he’s going to run races with
the boy and the dog! The boy with the fiddle, and the dog that
can dance, you know,” she explained rapidly. “Why, Grandpapa
Franzchen,” stroking his white hair with her dimpled
hand, “Max wants that boy and that dog, <em>so!</em> Please get
them for him, dear Grandpapa Emperor!”</p>

<p>When Betty commenced her story of the races to be run
with a boy who carried a violin, and a little dog that could
dance, a strange look had flashed into the Emperor’s eyes.
This deepened to one of amazement, and then his whole face
glowed with the thought within his heart.</p>

<p>It seemed that he was going to be able to give even more
pleasure than he had hoped.</p>

<p>“Well, Maxchen,” he laughed, “thou hast set thy grandfather
a hard task! To find, in his great city of Vienna, a boy who
plays the fiddle and who has a dog that dances! But he will
try, Liebchen,” patting his grandson’s head softly. “Would
you know them, should you see them again, little ones?” he
cried, quite as excited now as the children.</p>

<p>“Why, of course we would,” laughed Betty, for herself and
Max too: “there are only—<em>they</em>—you know, Grandpapa
dear!”</p>

<p>“I will commence to search for them this moment,” announced
the Emperor gaily, lifting Betty to the floor and rising
from his chair, “and the Herr Doctor shall help me! But what
wilt thou do with them, beside run races, should I find them for
thee?” he asked Max.</p>

<p>“I will make them happy,” said the little lame Prince.</p>

<p>As the two men were leaving the room, the Herr Doctor
turned. “Your Highness,” he said, “where will you go first,
when you walk to-night?”</p>

<p>“To my Emperor,” answered the boy proudly, raising one
little hand in salute.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p>Fritzl lifted his heavy eyelids, and looked about him, first
languidly, then wonderingly. Gone were the Riesenthor and
the Stephansplatz, and in place of them was a quiet room,
lined with books and hung with tapestries.</p>

<p>But the friendly eyes into which his gazed were still those
of “Santa Claus,” and the friendly hand which had touched
his bare head on the steps of the Giant’s Gate, held one of his
own. His violin lay on the couch beside him, while a warm
little tongue licking his hand, and the subdued but joyous
thumping of a stubby tail against the polished floor, told that
Tzandi was near.</p>

<p>So, all his fears relieved, Fritzl looked up happily to the man
who sat beside him, and asked: “Is this your house, dear Santa
Claus?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell him,” said “Unser Franz” to himself.
Then aloud: “Yes, little lad, it is my house. But it is the palace
of Schönbrunn, and I am only the Kaiser.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose you can’t help it,” sighed Fritzl, “but I
truly thought you were Santa Claus. You look exactly like
him!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the Emperor meekly, “and I will
try to be like him. Indeed, he sent me to thee, little lad, so
do not be disappointed. Another year thou shalt surely see
him. I—your Emperor—promise thee. And now, what wilt
thou choose first as a gift from him?”</p>

<p>“Something to eat for Tzandi and me,” leapt the swift
reply.</p>

<p>“Bless my heart,” laughed “Unser Franz,” ringing a silver
bell on the table beside him. Then, as a servant appeared, he
said, “Bring broth and bread and milk for the little lad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he went on, answering the question in Fritzl’s
eyes, “Tzandi has already eaten all that he possibly could.”</p>

<p>Then while Fritzl, propped with pillows on the broad lounge,
ate hungrily, they talked together.</p>

<p>“What is thy name, little lad?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp67" id="image016" style="max-width: 56.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image016.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Fritzl, sir—I
mean, Your Majesty,”
remembering
the words he had
heard the servant
use.</p>

<p>“Fritzl—and what
else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else,”
firmly, “just Fritzl.”</p>

<p>“But who were
thy father and
mother?”</p>

<p>“I never had any,”
the boy answered
gravely. “Once there
was Josef, the blind
fiddler, but since he went to heaven, there’s only been just the
violin and Tzandi and me.”</p>

<p>“And what art thou going to be, when thou art a man?”</p>

<p>“A great violinist!” flashed the prompt answer.</p>

<p>“And so thou shalt be, little Fritzl, if I can help thee to
it.”</p>

<p>When the boy had eaten the broth and bread, “Unser Franz”
rose.</p>

<p>“Now stay thou here, child, and rest,” he said; “after I
have wished my own dear little ones ‘Merry Christmas,’ I
will come back to thee.”</p>

<p>But the Emperor returned sooner than Fritzl had expected.</p>

<p>“For what dost thou think our Prince wishes most, this
Christmas morning?” he said excitedly, “why, a little boy
who can play the fiddle, and a little dog that can dance. Come
thou with me straight to him, Fritzchen!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp47" id="image017" style="max-width: 29.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image017.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Tucking his violin carefully under
his arm, the boy slipped one small
hand into the hand of the Emperor,
and followed by Tzandi, they went
from the room.</p>

<p>At the end of a long corridor, the
Emperor stopped before a closed
door.</p>

<p>“Go thou in alone, Fritzl,” he said
softly, opening the door: “there are
two little friends within who will welcome
thee.”</p>

<p>Very quietly, as if nothing more
could surprise him, that day of miracles, Fritzl crossed the
threshold, and stood within the room.</p>

<p>At one of the bay windows overlooking the terraced garden,
sat the little lame Prince and his sister, their curly heads bent
over a book.</p>

<p>“The dog looks something like the one that boy had,”
Fritzl heard the Prince say wistfully.</p>

<p>“Only he hasn’t such a dear funny tail as—”</p>

<p>But Betty never finished her sentence.</p>

<p>Tzandi, having been quiet as long as seemed to him desirable,
gave a soft little whine.</p>

<p>The brother and sister turned swiftly.</p>

<p>“It’s the boy with the violin!” cried Max.</p>

<p>“It’s the dog!” cried Betty.</p>

<p>“I told you so, Maxchen!” Betty announced triumphantly,
as a half hour later, explanations having been finished, the three
children and Tzandi clustered on the tiger skin, before the fire
of pine logs. “I told you Grandpapa Franzchen would bring
them to you. There isn’t anything in this world he can’t do.
And now, Fritzl, commence at the very first beginning, and tell
it all over again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Fritzl,” she cried, slipping a warm hand into his,
as he came to that part of his story, where Tzandi and he were
driven out of the doorways, in which they had sought shelter,
the night before.</p>

<p>“Poor little Fritzl,” echoed the Prince, “all cold and lonely!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t exactly lonely,” said Fritzl loyally, looking down
at Tzandi at his feet, sleeping the sleep of a well-fed dog, “but I
was awful hungry!”</p>

<p>“Well,” cried the small Archduchess stoutly, “it was the
very last time, Fritzl. You sha’n’t be hungry or cold any more,
ever again!”</p>

<p>“Sit thou closer to me, Fritzchen,” commanded the Prince:
“now I will tell thee my story.”</p>

<p>Then he told Fritzl how he had never been able to run or
walk like other boys. How, for nearly two years, the famous
surgeon had been treating him. How, that very Christmas
night, he was to walk for the first time.</p>

<p>“But if he fail?” faltered Fritzl, tears of anxiety in his eyes
and voice.</p>

<p>“He will not fail,” the Prince said proudly: “he never fails
anyone—my Herr Doctor! And now, Fritzl,” all a boy’s
love of fun flashing into his eyes, “make Tzandi dance!”</p>

<p>And <em>how</em> Tzandi danced!</p>

<p>Back and forth, up and down the room, while Fritzl fiddled
merrily, and Max and Betty clapped their hands in delight.</p>

<p>For Tzandi realized that the time had come for him to do
honor to his little master’s training, and never did a dog dance
as he, that Christmas Day!</p>

<p>He was still waltzing blithely, his fore paws waving ecstatically
in the air, when the Emperor came into the room. “I
have come to hear thee fiddle, Fritzl,” he said, taking Betty
into his arms, and seating himself in the great arm-chair beside
the Prince. “Play me one of the dances my children of Hungary
love.”</p>

<p>So Fritzl played, standing proudly yet very modestly before
his Kaiser. And the old Emperor, closing his eyes, saw once
more that village on the Danube, where, a boy about the age
of the three children, he had been taught to dance the czardas;
heard once more the chant of the pines, and the laughter of the
Hungarian peasants, who had danced with him.</p>

<p>“Little lad,” he said, as the song died plaintively away,
“God has given thee the greatest of his gifts. And now,”
he went on, “play that which shall make these children think
of the brave deeds of their ancestors.”</p>

<p>And Fritzl played: deep chords and crashing measures,
underneath which was the tramp of feet, and the clash of sword
blades.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, Grandpapa,” cried Max excitedly, “canst thou
not hear them? The tramp of the men and the tramp of the
horses of Rudolph, going forth to victory over Ottokar of Bohemia?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="image021" style="max-width: 32.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image021.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Oh, and the sound of swords drawn swiftly,” Betty cried,
nestling closer into her grandfather’s arms.</p>

<p>“And now,” said “Unser Franz” softly, “play thou that
song which neither thou nor these other little orphaned ones
ever heard. The song that mothers sing.”</p>

<p>Again Fritzl played: and the sound was like the ripple of
quiet waters, like the rustle of rain-drenched poplar leaves,
like the cadence of a woman’s voice, hushing her little child to
sleep upon her breast.</p>

<p>Again the Emperor closed his eyes, and saw his mother’s
face, and heard the song his beautiful wife used to sing to their
only son, long dead.</p>

<p>Then, brushing the tears from his eyes, he cried cheerily to
Fritzl: “Play thou the ‘Kaiser Hymn!’ And then,” kissing
the forehead of the boy beside him, “the Prince must rest.”</p>

<p>Fritzl drew himself to his tallest, tucked his violin more
firmly under his chin, and to its measures sang in his clear young
voice, the other children joining eagerly,—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p>In the “Blue Salon” of Schönbrunn, the imperial family
awaited the coming of the Emperor and the Prince, talking
together softly, not only of “Maxchen,” as they called him
lovingly, but of Fritzl, whose story had spread throughout the
palace.</p>

<p>At last, the Hofmeister threw open impressively the east
door of the salon, and across its threshold, and down the pathway
made for him by his family, the Emperor passed slowly.
Lightly holding his right hand, trying to walk demurely, but
fluttering along like a white rosebud softly blown, was the
little Archduchess Betty. Tightly clinging to his left hand,
walked a boy, holding a violin. Behind, went the Archduke
Max, in his wheeled chair, and beside him was the great
surgeon.</p>

<p>At the dais, on one side of the salon, the three children and
the Herr Doctor halted, while the Emperor mounted its steps,
and bowing to those assembled, who curtsied and bowed deeply
in return, took his seat upon the golden throne.</p>

<p>It was all very solemn and stately. And Fritzl felt rather
lonely. He missed Tzandi, among all these strange and awe-inspiring
people.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he thought to himself, “if they’re both dreams—last
night, in the Stephansplatz, and here, to-night!”</p>

<p>Now just at that moment there came the sound of subdued
but excited voices at the east door of the salon. The dignified
Hofmeister was seen to plunge wildly forward, in a vain attempt
to bar the way. And then—and then—(as long as he lives,
Fritzl says he can never forget the mingling of surprise and joy
and shame which flooded his heart) a little terrier dog, ears
and tail erect in the pride of victory, trotted through the door,
and across the room to the three children, grouped at the foot
of the throne. Looking up into Fritzl’s scarlet face, he wagged
his stumpy tail joyously, and giving three sharp little barks
of salutation, sat up on his hind legs, his fore paws waving
politely. One ear erect, the other drooping in that deprecating
fashion, which means that a little dog knows he is doing what
he should not, but really can not help it.</p>

<p>How he reached his master remains a mystery unto this
day. But there he was.</p>

<p>Laughing heartily with the rest, the Emperor said, “Although
an uninvited, thou art a welcome guest, Monsieur Tzandi!”
While Max and Betty patted his shaggy head, as he trotted
from one to the other, licking their hands with his soft red
tongue.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the Emperor nodded to the Herr Doctor.</p>

<p>The face of the little Prince grew white; but there was no
trace of fear or doubt in the blue eyes, lifted to the great surgeon’s
face.</p>

<p>Betty tried to smile bravely at him, creeping closer to Fritzl,
and slipping her hand within his. While to Fritzl himself it
seemed as if everyone must hear the beating of his heart, so
frightened was he.</p>

<p>Then, very tenderly, the Herr Doctor lifted the Prince from
his wheeled chair, and stood him carefully on the dais, a few
feet from the Emperor’s throne. Involuntarily, both Betty
and Fritzl moved nearer, each stretching out a trembling hand
as if to help him. But Max stood steadily.</p>

<p>“Maxchen, Maxchen,” called softly the Emperor, his face
as white as his snowy hair, “come thou to me, dear
child!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp49" id="image025" style="max-width: 41.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image025.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The boy gave a last look into the good Doctor’s eyes, which
were strangely dim.</p>

<p>“Go thou, little lad,” said the surgeon gently.</p>

<p>Then the Prince walked bravely into his grandfather’s outstretched
arms.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p>When the tumult of congratulation had somewhat subsided,
and Max had walked proudly back to the great surgeon (happiest
perhaps of all those present), the Emperor rose, and silence
fell upon the room. His voice trembled a little, from excitement
and relief, but the fresh color had come back to his kind face.</p>

<p>“Good friends and mine own people,” he said, “of that
which the Herr Doctor has done for the Prince—for me—for
you—for the empire—I can not speak. There are no
words for that which is within my heart. Only my life henceforth
can prove its gratitude.” Then beckoning to Fritzl, who
mounted the steps of the dais fearlessly, and stood beside him,
the Emperor continued: “Somewhat over a hundred years
ago this Christmas night, a little lad, one Mozart, sat at yonder
spinet, and played to our great Empress and her children.
To-night, a little lad shall play to you. This little lad, Fritzl,
whom I believe God means to become as great a musician, as
became that child of long ago. He has known cold and hunger
and neglect. But he has been a brave lad, and none of these
things shall he ever know again.”</p>

<p>“Now Fritzchen, play to these thy friends,” he commanded
kindly, reseating himself upon his golden throne.</p>

<p>Slim and straight, in his suit of black velvet, Fritzl stood
beside him, looking about the brilliant room. At first he was
timid and the little hand which raised the violin to his shoulder
trembled. But looking into the gentle face beside him, and
down at the smiling ones of the good Herr Doctor, Max and
Betty and Tzandi, he thought of nothing but pleasing them.</p>

<p>So, wholly forgetting himself, he cuddled his violin closely
under his chin, and whispering to it lovingly, played.</p>

<p>Played as he had played that afternoon, in the quiet chamber
to the Emperor and his grandchildren; and all curiosity and
indifference died away, and those who listened, held their
breath in surprised delight. For he brought to them the cool
sweet breath of pine woods, the ripple of April leaves, the sound
of voices long unheard but never to be forgotten. And when
at last, at the Emperor’s
request, he played “the
song that mothers sing,”
into many eyes which for
long had not felt them,
crept tears. Then his bow
dropped and he looked wistfully
into the Emperor’s face.
There was a moment of absolute
silence, and then the
room re-echoed with applause.
It came with such
a crash that once more
Fritzl was frightened, and
shrank closer to the Kaiser.
Seeing the boy was overwrought, “Unser Franz” said
quickly, “Now he shall play for you the noblest hymn our
‘Vater Haydn’ ever wrote. And then, the little ones shall
dance!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp59" id="image028" style="max-width: 49.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image028.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Once again, Fritzl lifted his shining bow. The voices of the
people joined that of the violin, and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze</span>”
rang through the room, as it had never before been
sung there. For every heart rejoiced that the little Prince
could walk, and they knew that to the lad who played to <a id="them"></a>them,
God had given the gift of genius. Then the Emperor ordered
the salon prepared for the children to dance.</p>

<p>The older members of the imperial family made their obeisances
and departed. And at last, only the children of the house
of Habsburg and a few of the younger matrons remained with
the Emperor.</p>

<p>Once more the great Christmas tree blazed with candles,
while about it danced the children hand in hand.</p>

<p>Then Fritzl tuned his violin carefully. “May I play for
them to dance?” he said.</p>

<p>“Unser Franz” nodded a smiling consent.</p>

<p>Then, back and forth over the tense strings flew the gleaming
bow, and the waltz the elder Strauss wrote for the music and
dance loving Viennese, and which they love above all others—“Die
Schöne Blaue Donau”—vibrated through the Blue
Salon.</p>

<p>Back and forth, like butterflies, danced the children, curls
and ribbons blowing, little feet twinkling on the polished floor,
while the Emperor beat time on the arms of his throne and
smiled happily, greeting them all as they fluttered by.</p>

<p>At the foot of the throne, two boys watched the dancing.
The “little lame Prince,” lame no longer. The little “waif,”
a waif no longer, and to-day, one of the world’s great violinists.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt be dancing with them, next Christmas, Liebchen,”
said the Emperor, patting his grandson’s curly head.</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s, sir,” assented Max, without enthusiasm; “but
oh, Grandpapa Franzchen,” he cried excitedly, “I’d rather run
races in the garden with Betty and Fritzl and Tzandi!”</p>

<p>“Well, thou canst do both,” laughed “Unser Franz.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear me,” sighed Betty, as the candles having burnt
low in the sconces, and upon the great tree, the last good nights
were being said: “Christmas is all over!”</p>

<p>“It will come again next year, little sister, it always does,”
consoled Max, “and next year it will be nicer for Fritzl, because
he missed the Christmas tree last night, you know, Betty!”</p>

<p>“It <em>couldn’t</em> be nicer,” cried Fritzl, smiling gratefully at the
little brother and sister: “it’s the very most beautifullest Christmas
that ever was!” And Tzandi, whirling delightedly on his
hind legs, barked an ecstatic assent.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
